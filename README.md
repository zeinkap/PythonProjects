# A Collection of Python Projects
A series of programs written in Python to perform various tasks.

## Motivation
_To learn and practice Python_

## Synopsis:
### **Dog Age:**
_This program asks the user for their dogs age and then prints the results in dogs years_

### **Even or Odd:**
_This program asks the user for a number and then print the output telling the user if the number is even or odd._

### **Greeting program:**
_This program asks the user for various data about themself and prints output accordingly._

This program also does the following:

    * Asks the user what their name is
    * The output will be “Nice to meet you” and add the person’s name
    * Asks the user what their favorite color is
    * The output will be said color followed by “That’s a nice color” (Ex: Blue? That’s a nice color)
    * Asks the user their favorite food
    * The output will be said food followed by “sounds yummy” (Ex. Pizza sounds yummy)
    * Asks the user if they have to go and if they say “no” loop the program again*

### **Prime Number:**
_This program displays all the prime numbers from 2 – 100._

Also, it states that it’s a prime number next to the number.  (Ex: 2 is a Prime number)
**NOTE:** A prime number is a whole number greater than 1, who is only divisible by 1 and itself.

### **User Input:**
_Given a set of numbers, this program returns the largest and smallest number in the set._

This program also does the following:

    * Accepts X amount of numbers from a user
    * Stores each value in a list
    * Creates one or more functions which return the maximum number in the list.
    * Creates one or  more functions which return the smallest number in the list.

### **Guessing Game:**
_This program is a game that does the following:_

    *Generates a random number from 1 to 10 (Look up the appropriate python class/function to do this)
    * Asks the user to guess the number.
    * Gives the user three guess to get the number correct.
    * If the user guesses correctly, exits the game and congratulates the user.
    * If the user fails gives the appropriate error message and exit the game.
    * Modifies the program so that following requirements are met.
    * If the user is within one of the correct answer displays “Hot”
    * If the user is within two of the correct answer displays “Warm”
    * All other guesses displays “Cold”

### **Quadratic:**
_This program solves for the value of a quadratic._

**NOTE:** A quadratic follows the format of AX2+BX + C (A,B,C are variables) You should test your for multiple combinations of positive and negative values of all variables.

This program also does the following:

    * Asks the user to enter the value of A,B,C and X.
    * Calculates the value of the quadratic.
    * Outputs the quadratic along with the value of the quadratic.
